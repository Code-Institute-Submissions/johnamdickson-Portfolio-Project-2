## UX
### Site Goals
The objective of the site is to create a two player memory card game directed towards young children and their parents. The site should give feedback on successful matches. It should also  keep track of the scores and feedback the game outcome once all cards are turned over.
### User Stories
- As an adult user:
  - I want to play a game with my children that challenges their memory and spatial awareness.
  - I want the game to encourage turn taking by giving feedback on which player's turn it is.
  - I want to be able to play the game on all devices including PC/Mac, tablets and mobile phones.
  - I want responsive feedback from buttons and cards on the website.
<br><br>
- As a child user:
  - I want to engage in a fun game with my parents or caregiver.
  - I want to be visually stimulated by the site including background picture, card pictures and colours.
<br><br>
- As the site administrator:
  - I want to easily identify issues or bugs by providing clear and concise code with annotations.

## Design
### Logo
![Site Logo](/assets/README-files/logo.png)
- The choice of site logo was based upon one that would be fun and engaging for children and have an immediate connection with the content. 
### Colour Scheme
- 
- 

### Typography

All fonts were sourced from Google Fonts. The main font used throughout is called 'Love Ya Like A Sister' which was selected for it's fun characteristics that children can relate too even if they cannot read. Raleway was selected for button font to make it stand out to adults who will normally be controlling the game.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __The Game Information Div__ <br><br>
![Game-Information](assets/README-files/game-information.png)

  - The game information div contains an `<h2>` welcome message and short `<p>` giving an overview of the game. There are two buttons at the bottom of the div -  *New Game* and *How To Play*. The former button gives the option to restart the game whilst the latter directs the user to an instructions div described below. The buttons are styled to have an embossed look using inset box shadows along with an outset shadow. The buttons have mousedown and mouseup event listeners where the mousedown removes the outset shadow and the mouseup returns the styling to normal. This creates the impression of the button being pressed and springing back to position once released.<br><br>
- __The Game Instructions Div__ <br><br>
![Game-Instructions](/assets/README-files/game-instructions.jpg) 

  - When the *How To Play* button is pressed two divs  - blurred and instructions - are made visible from their default hidden property. The blurred div covers the entire screen and creates a visual effect that accentuates the instructions div and contents and helps create a contrast against the backdrop of the game. The instructions div contains an `<ol>` of instructions followed by *New Game* and *Go Back* buttons. The former button completes the same action as its namesake described in Game Information above, whilst the latter returns the user to the current game. Both buttons return the two divs to their default visibility status of hidden.<br><br>

- __The Player Information Div__ <br><br>
![Player-Information](/assets/README-files/player-info.gif)
  - The player info div contains two divs showing which player's turn it is and a scores area. The player info updates dynamically once the players turn changes. The scores area contains the player scores and updates on a successful match of animals. In order to draw the users attention here after the site loads or a new game is selected, the elements animate in after a short time delay.

- __The Game Area__ <br><br>
![Game Area](/assets/README-files/game-area.gif)
    - The game area consists of a div of the site blue colour with embossed edges and rounded corners. A 4 x 4 grid element is contained within this div and holds all 16 of the game cards. 
    - Each game card has two sides, the reverse side and the front side containing the animal pictures.
    - When the user hovers over a card the cursor changes to a pointer. The card is responsively styled to marginally grow along with the border getting slightly thicker using the the hover pseudo element.
    - When an unsuccessful match is made, the cards turn back around and the turn changes to the alternate player.
    - When a successful match is made, a congratualtory message (described below) is displayed and the incumbent player gets another turn.
    - The cards remain turned over revealing the animal pictures after a successful match.
    - The game continues until all animal pairs are matched at which point a game outcome message appears, again described below.
